          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

     <p class="quotes">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
        it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
        course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
        Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

         “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
        really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
        able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
        developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
        attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

       <p class="red">“ Before joining
        the bootcamp, I’ ve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
        step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
        staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
        wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
        interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
        offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
